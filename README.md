#  Second Annual Data Science Bowl solution #

Due to organizational mistakes in second phase our team was hihgly overfitted and finished on 168th place.

Without making such mistake we were chances to place near to the 50th position.

## Main contributions ##

We developed 2d landmark detection for SAX and 2CH left ventricle projections. Landmarks drawn with red.

Also we made some experiments on 3D reconstruction using MeshLab software.
